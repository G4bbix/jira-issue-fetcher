# jira-issue-fetcher

Have you ever been to lazy to get a Jira Issue from Firefox while writing a commit message? I did, and thus wrote this little script, that extracts all tabs bein on a Jira issue, displays them in ROFI and writes them down.

## Requirements
- bash
- python (Built with 3.11, others probably work too)
- python-lz4
- xdotool
- rofi
- firefox (If you want to add another browser, feel free to open an PR)
